Maven Java Automation Steps:
 Step 1: Open Jenkins (localhost:8080)
   	 ├── Click on "New Item" (left side menu
Step 2: Create Freestyle Project (e.g., MavenJava_Build)
        	├── Enter project name (e.g., MavenJava_Build)
        	├── Click "OK"
└── Configure the project:
            		├── Description: "Java Build demo"
            		├── Source Code Management:
            			└── Git repository URL: [GitMavenJava repo URL]
            		├── Branches to build: */Main   or  */master
  		└── Build Steps:
               	     ├── Add Build Step -> "Invoke top-level Maven targets"
                  		└── Maven version: MAVEN_HOME
                 		└── Goals: clean
                	├── Add Build Step -> "Invoke top-level Maven targets"
                		└── Maven version: MAVEN_HOME
                		└── Goals: install
                	└── Post-build Actions:
                    	       ├── Add Post Build Action -> "Archive the artifacts"
                    			└── Files to archive: **/*
                    	     ├── Add Post Build Action -> "Build other projects"
                    			└── Projects to build: MavenJava_Test
                    			└── Trigger: Only if build is stable
                    	     └── Apply and Save


    └── Step 3: Create Freestyle Project (e.g., MavenJava_Test)
        	├── Enter project name (e.g., MavenJava_Test)
        	├── Click "OK"
              └── Configure the project:
             ├── Description: "Test demo"
             ├── Build Environment:
            		└── Check: "Delete the workspace before build starts"
            ├── Add Build Step -> "Copy artifacts from another project"
            		└── Project name: MavenJava_Build
            		└── Build: Stable build only  // tick at this
            		└── Artifacts to copy: **/*
            ├── Add Build Step -> "Invoke top-level Maven targets"
            		└── Maven version: MAVEN_HOME
            		└── Goals: test
            		└── Post-build Actions:
                ├── Add Post Build Action -> "Archive the artifacts"
                	└── Files to archive: **/*
                	└── Apply and Save

    └── Step 4: Create Pipeline View for Maven Java project
        ├── Click "+" beside "All" on the dashboard
        ├── Enter name: MavenJava_Pipeline
        ├── Select "Build pipeline view"         // tick here

            ├── Layout: Based on upstream/downstream relationship
            ├── Initial job: MavenJava_Build
            └── Apply and Save OK

    └── Step 5: Run the Pipeline and Check Output
        ├── Click on the trigger to run the pipeline
        ├── click on the small black box to open the console to check if the build is success
            Note : 
1.	If build is success and the test project is also automatically triggered with name       
                      “MavenJava_Test”
2.	The pipeline is successful if it is in green color as shown ->check the console of the test project
3.	The test project is successful and all the artifacts are archived successfully

               Note:
1.	 It ask for user credentials for login ,provide the credentials of tomcat.
2.	It provide the page with out project name which is highlighted.
3.	After clicking on our project we can see output.

11.	List at least five Jenkins plugins that you would consider important for a microservices-based application CI/CD pipeline. Briefly explain the purpose of each plugin.
12.	Explain the steps you would take to install a plugin in Jenkins through the Jenkins UI. What considerations would you keep in mind regarding plugin compatibility and updates?
13.	Explain the steps you would take to install a plugin in Jenkins through the Jenkins UI. What considerations would you keep in mind regarding plugin compatibility and updates?
14.	After installing a plugin, explain how you would configure it within Jenkins. For example, if you installed the Git Plugin, what steps would you take to set it up for your pipeline?
15.	Discuss common issues that might arise when using Jenkins plugins, such as dependency conflicts or version compatibility problems. How would you troubleshoot these issues?
